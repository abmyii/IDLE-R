CHANGE TO PySide (GET FIRST!)!

show "(" and ")" in red/other color when selected (match_braces)

Add all menuBar options

Make sidebar more advanced (maybe show mode (insert/replace) and stuff)

When import, add all namespaces of the module for auto-completion
(If import in line, then eval loc and if worked, add namespaces)

code folding

When there are braces, show doc str of the module and arg called with showToolTip

Use (widget).addAction for auto-completion. For __init__ of the widget, set parent to QTextEdit

Make my own console (pyshell) using QtGui.QDockWidget, and add it to main window 
using self.addDockWidget. (? Use ipython console?)

Make colorscheme customizable (and editor bg)

Spell check?

Split view!?

pip/flask8/pylint/pip/(like spyder, where shows unused imports and stuff...)?

# Key bindings
F5 = Python2 Run (OR set as choose py2/py3)
F6 = Python3 Run (OR set as choose py2/py3)

Terminal in the window
Project browsing

Debugger

Toolbar with all shortcuts needed

When done this ide, save as base-ide for other ides (build on this one)

(When making proper django/python version)
AST (+ Assembly) viewer?
Git intergration?
Vim intergration? (Update sidebar to add this)

RENAME. Ideas: DreamDjango(Dream/DreamCode studios?!) DevPy DreamPython
(Make full version and sell?! & free (not full) version? (community?))
